# 🍓 Seasonal
The app that helps you pick the perfect fruits at the perfect time.

## 🫐 [Try it out here!](https://seasonal-app.vercel.app/)
Seasonal is an app that scans fruits and informs consumers on the fruit ripeness, seasonality, and recipe selection. 
The trained AI model accurately depicts the image from the camera and provide the user with the number one match. The model will analyze the ripeness of the fruit and inform the user, as well as come up with recipes to use that produce in. 

## 🍋 How we built it
The app was designed on Figma as a prototype and then developed and implemented via React and Tailwind CSS. The AI model was taught using TeachableMachines through inputting hundreds of images of various fruits and their corresponding “ripeness” state.

## 🍉 Inspiration
I am an avid fruit lover, but buying fruits, especially berries and melons can be a little bit of a struggle, so I came up with the idea to create an app that helps identify the perfect stage of the fruit, so everyone can get the 

## 🥦 Future Enhancements
- Further refine the Seasonal ripeness detection system by training the machine learning algorithm and image recognition technology with more images and data.
- Expand Seasonal’s database to include a wider variety of fruits and vegetables from different regions worldwide.
